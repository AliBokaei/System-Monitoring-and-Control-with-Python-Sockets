# System-Monitoring-and-Control-with-Python-Sockets
This system allows a central manager to collect system statistics (CPU usage, memory usage, running process count) and issue commands (like system restart) to multiple endpoint agents. Communication is done over TCP for command and response, and UDP for asynchronous alerts (e.g., high CPU usage alerts).
